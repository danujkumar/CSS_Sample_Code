                            The grand fest of Aavartan had its seed sown back in 2007, when few
                            Technical enthusiasts came up with the idea of "Vigyaan"-the
                            national level science exhibition, single event back then which
                            eventually transformed into magnificent Aavartan as we see it today.

                            Aavartan. The consistent efforts and out of the box ideas of the
                            team members laid the foundation for what now is called as the
                            trademark of tech-fests!
